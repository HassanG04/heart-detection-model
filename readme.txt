I was tasked with this project in order to test my knowledge of Machine learning and Data analysis.
in this project I cleaned,analysed,visualized and extracted features from data.
with the features extracted I compared two machine models (i.e RandomForest and XGBoost with XGBoost achieving the highest accuracy score)
Then used XGBoost to detect if the person got heart disease or not taking input via application (using Tkinter).


This project was assisted by:
    -Medical students in order to better understand the dataset
    -Online resources in order to better understand syntax:
        -https://github.com/AIBabyTeaching/MACHINE-LEARNING-FEB-2025
        -https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_plotting.asp (For pandas)
        -https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/learning-model-building-scikit-learn-python-machine-learning-library/ (For sklearn)
        -YouTube and Google for reSearch purposes
        -DeepSeek to improve on visiuals and help with Tkinter
        -CoPilot to Write the code faster instead of typing the entire code
Python Version : 3.11.11
